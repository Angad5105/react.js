<h1>What is React?</h1>
<p>React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. He was influenced by XHP, an HTML component framework for PHP. It was first deployed on Facebook's newsfeed in 2011 and later on Instagram.com in 2012. It was open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013.</p>
<p>In computing, React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.</p>


<h1>How react is useful?</h1>
<p>React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. Complex React applications usually require the use of additional libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API.</p>

![react2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24455909/45919987-f3b32600-be52-11e8-9f6e-76f9d0a72f5f.jpeg)

<p>Properties are passed to a component from the parent component. Components receive props as a single set of immutable values(a JavaScript object). At the heart of all React applications are components. A component is a selfcontained module that renders some output. We can ırite interface
elements like a button or an input field as a React component. Components
are composable. A component might include one or more other components
in its output.</p>

<p>React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”. Importantly, each component in a React app abides y strict data
management principles. </p>

<h1>How react will help?</h1>
<p>This term we are working on a project called medler which is related to pharmacy management system and we can use fusion charts with react to show the data visualization.</p>


<h1>Prototype</h1>

<h2>Prototype Idea</h2>
<p>We are working on a project called Pharmacy Management System, in which our motive is to provide a simple interface of pharmacy management system to the pharmacy owners in some specific countries in Asia. It will be usefull in maintaining the pharmacy records like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sales</li>
<li>Manufacturing Date</li>
<li>Expiry Date</li>
<li>Brands</li>
<li>Companies</li>
</ul>

<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>My resposibilityis to work on the front-end of the project using React, HTML, CSS, Javascript to enhance the working of our web application.</p>


<h2>Mockups</h2>

<p>It will also help in predicting and keeping records of the heath problems and trending medicies available and what do people usually buy.</p>

<h1>Final Prototype</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>We are working on project name Medler which is basically a pharmacy management system of sales and stocks which will be used by various pharmasicst. In this project I am resposible for the front-end part using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Jquery and managing the database at the back-end using php and Mysql.</p>
 
 <p>I will be designing home landing page and a user management system for our web application Medler. It is basically login and signup.</p>
 
 <h2>Features</h2>
  <p>1: User will go to the front page of the application where they can get an overview of the app.</p>
  <p>2: User can signup thourgh the front page to use the app.</p>
  <p>3: User will Signin first and then can use their dashboard.</p>
  <p>4: User can update their profile.</p>
  
  <h2>Project User Stories</h2>
  <p>As a user they can make their profile and start using the dashboard according to their needs like manage stocks, sales, brands, deliveries.</p>
  
  
  <p>The pharmacist will provide all the information regarding pharmacy as well as has control over entering the data of the live stock.</p>
  
  <p>The administrator will provide full service reagarding the app and will give the control to the pharmacist according to the plan they buy.</p>

<h2>Retrospective</h2>
<p>As of now I have started my work on the login and signup front-end properties as when user login it make sure everything is right as well as in signup that email is already used or not. On the other hand I am also learning react by watching tutorial on Lynda.com and Youtube.</p>

<h2>This Week</h2>
<p> This week I will be done with the login and signup and start with the home landing page.</p>
 
 <h2>What went well?</h2>
 <p>The login and signup criteria worked as we hoped.</p>

 <p>I am facing difficulty to integrate react with server side. This is main problem we are worried about as all of us except one member took react as main subject.</p>
 
 <h2>What needs to be improved?</h2>
 <p>Need to clear more logics as I learn programming little bit slow and I am trying to learn a technology first time on my own.</p>
 
 <h2>What is next?</h2>

<h2>Retrospective</h2>
<p>As of now we are almost done with our project, just few things left like:</p>
   <p>1: Connecting home landing page with our back-end so that we can make a demo of fully functional demo of login and signup.</p>
   <p>2: On the other hand I am working on fully functional google maps to show that in our contact form.</p>

<h2>This Week</h2>
<p> As tyler suggested me to make some changes in styles of the front-end, so going to do that.</p>
 
 <h2>What went well?</h2>
 <p>All the things are working fine on my part of front-end. Things are working in systematic way, just need add some fixes in google map.</p>
 
 <h2>What went wrong?</h2>
 <p>The plans of changing the technogy of not using react affected a lot on all aspects especially on directed studies and the time.</p>
 
 <h2>What needs to be improved?</h2>
 <p>Probably need a lot of coding practice. I am little slow in programming. I was learning react at my speed but with in between change of the project honestly I also lost the interest and started focusing on other things like working on front-end and managing the database.</p>
 
 <h2>What is next?</h2>
 <p>I will surely start reactjs again and also while doing this project I gained more interest in database, so I am going to work on data administration too.</p> 
 
  <h2>What would be done differently?</h2>
  <p> Honestly working in this project I like to work on database maybe that would be the better thing I would have done in the first place.</p>

<h1>Final Check-in, Retrospective</h1>


<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We were working on project name Medler which is basically a pharmacy management system of sales and stocks which will be used by various pharmasicst. In this project I am resposible for the front-end part using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Jquery and managing the database at the back-end using php and Mysql.</p>

<p>This is the final post of this subject. During the project time the team decided not to use react, that created a big change and we have to do it in a another way. </p>

 
<h2>What worked well?</h2>
<p>After changing the plan we innovate to how to finish the project and then it was my responsibility to develop front-end and that gave me a confidence in development because I lack in programming, I learn slow but I try hard to make this and it cleared lot of my concepts.</p>

<h2>Retrospective last week</h2>
<p>1: I helped the team to merge all the contents of the project.</p>
<p>2: I created the demo video of the project as a backup if something dosn't work at the time of presentation.</p>
<p>3: Screenshots</p>

<h2>What needs to be improved & what I would do different?</h2>
<p>I need to dedicate more time in my coding practice so I can fit in the industy level.</p>
<p>Also I will be learning database as while working in the project I liked the part of managing database, so that is something I will look forward to.</p>

<h2>Retrospective lof the Journey</h2>
<p>It was a journey of great learning process through this time of 12 weeks. I learned many new things like more concepts of javascript and CSS, MySql, Php as in this project I worked mostly on front-end but helped in managing database too.</p>
<p>In the future I would like to learn React from where I left and also redux. Also I will try to work hard on my coding skills so that I can put efforts to the project in the next term.</p>

<h1>What is React?</h1>
<p>React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. He was influenced by XHP, an HTML component framework for PHP. It was first deployed on Facebook's newsfeed in 2011 and later on Instagram.com in 2012. It was open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013.</p>
<p>In computing, React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.</p>


<h1>How react is useful?</h1>
<p>React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. Complex React applications usually require the use of additional libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API</p>

![react2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24455909/45919987-f3b32600-be52-11e8-9f6e-76f9d0a72f5f.jpeg)

<p>Properties are passed to a component from the parent component. Components receive props as a single set of immutable values(a JavaScript object). At the heart of all React applications are components. A component is a selfcontained module that renders some output. We can ırite interface
elements like a button or an input field as a React component. Components
are composable. A component might include one or more other components
in its output.</p>

<p>React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”. Importantly, each component in a React app abides y strict data
management principles. </p>


<h1>Prototype</h1>

<p>We are working on a project called Pharmacy Management System, in which our motive is to provide a simple interface of pharmacy management system to the pharmacy owners in some specific countries in Asia. It will be usefull in maintaining the pharmacy records like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sales</li>
<li>Manufacturing Date</li>
<li>Expiry Date</li>
<li>Brands</li>
<li>Companies</li>
</ul>

<p>It will also help in predicting and keeping records of the heath problems and trending medicies available and what do people usually buy.</p>

 <h1>20% Progress Report</h1>


<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We are working on project name Medler which is basically a pharmacy management system of sales and stocks which will be used by various pharmasicst. In this project I am resposible for the front-end part using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Jquery and managing the database at the back-end using php and Mysql.</p>

<h2>Retrospective</h2>
<p>As of now I have started the research on react and started practicing some of the programs by following the tutorials on 
lynda.com and Youtube. I have decided to continue with the react.</p>

<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>My plan is to use react in the project as for login and signup as well as fusion charts for the data visualization.</p>
 
 <h2>What went well?</h2>
 <p>I am reviewing the tutorials of react working with fusion charts so that we can start the main part of our project.</p>
 
 <h2>What needs to be improved?</h2>
 <p>I need to improve the my coding methods and time management.</p>
 
 <h2>What is next?</h2>
 <p>Looking further to work on the front-end of the project as well as back-end with other teamates.</p>

<h2>Retrospective</h2>
<p>As of now I have started my work on the login and signup front-end properties as when user login it make sure everything is right as well as in signup that email is already used or not. On the other hand I am also learning react by watching tutorial on Lynda.com and Youtube.</p>

<h2>This Week</h2>
<p> This week I will be done with the login and signup and start with the home landing page.</p>
 
 <h2>What went well?</h2>
 <p>The login and signup criteria worked as we hoped.</p>
 
 <h2>What went wrong?</h2>
 <p>I am facing difficulty to integrate react with server side. This is main problem we are worried about as all of us except one member took react as main subject.</p>
 
 <h2>What needs to be improved?</h2>
 <p>Need to clear more logics as I learn programming little bit slow and I am trying to learn a technology first time on my own.</p>
 
 <h2>What is next?</h2>
 <p>Looking further to work on the front-end of the project as well as back-end with other teammates.</p>

 <h2>Retrospective</h2>
 <p>As of now the team has decided not to continue with the react as we are facing difficulty to integrate react with php and because of that I have to work on the front-end again and continue to work on the parts that were divided in the begining of the project.</p>
 
  <p>1: Login and Signup</p>

<h2>This Week</h2>
<p> This week I am continuing with the home landing page as well as the database.</p>

 <h2>What needs to be improved?</h2>
 <p>1: Coding Skill</p>
 <p>2: Time Management</p>
 
 <h2>What went wrong?</h2>
 <p>Sudden change of technology is the reason of more pressure and time. On the other hand there is no use of react now as we started the project with that.</p>
 
 <h2>What went well?</h2>
 <p>We got to know the problem early and we can still make it to the final project.</p>

<h2>Retrospective</h2>
<p>As of now we are almost done with our project, just few things left like:</p>
   <p>1: Connecting home landing page with our back-end so that we can make a demo of fully functional demo of login and signup.</p>
   <p>2: On the other hand I am working on fully functional google maps to show that in our contact form.</p>

<h2>This Week</h2>
<p> As tyler suggested me to make some changes in styles of the front-end, so going to do that.</p>
 
 <h2>What went well?</h2>
 <p>All the things are working fine on my part of front-end. Things are working in systematic way, just need add some fixes in google map.</p>
 
 <h2>What went wrong?</h2>
 <p>The plans of changing the technogy of not using react affected a lot on all aspects especially on directed studies and the time.</p>
 
 <h2>What needs to be improved?</h2>
 <p>Probably need a lot of coding practice. I am little slow in programming. I was learning react at my speed but with in between change of the project honestly I also lost the interest and started focusing on other things like working on front-end and managing the database.</p>
 
 <h2>What is next?</h2>
 <p>I will surely start reactjs again and also while doing this project I gained more interest in database, so I am going to work on data administration too.</p> 
 
  <h2>What would be done differently?</h2>
  <p> Honestly working in this project I like to work on database maybe that would be the better thing I would have done in the first place.</p>
